  - role: Visiting Researcher
    time: May 2023 - Feb 2024
    company: Bionics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology
    details: |
      Designed and implemented a deep learning model to predict blood pressure 
      from ECG (electrocardiogram) and PPG (photoplethysmogram) waveforms, 
      enabling non-invasive and continuous cuffless monitoring.
      In addition, conducted research on brain-computer interface that 
      control exoskeleton robot using motor imagery.

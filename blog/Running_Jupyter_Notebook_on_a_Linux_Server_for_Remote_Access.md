# Running Jupyter Notebook on a Linux Server for Remote Access

1. Install Jupyter Notebook on your Linux server. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
$ pip install jupyter
```

Launch the Jupyter Notebook server by running the following command:

```
$ jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=<port_number>
```

Replace <port_number> with the port number you want to use. This will start the Jupyter Notebook server and make it accessible from any device that can connect to your Linux server.

Open your web browser on your local computer and navigate to http://<server_ip>:<port_number> where <server_ip> is the IP address of your Linux server and <port_number> is the port number you specified in step 2.

For example, if your server's IP address is 192.168.1.100 and you used port 8888, you would navigate to http://192.168.1.100:8888 in your web browser.

Jupyter Notebook will ask you for a token to access the server. This token is generated when you start the server in step 2. You can find the token in the output of the jupyter notebook command in your terminal. It will look something like this:

```
To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
    file:///home/user/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-1234-open.html
Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    http://localhost:8888/?token=abcdef1234567890
```

Copy the token from the URL and paste it into the password prompt in your web browser.

You should now have access to your Jupyter Notebook server from your web browser. You can create new notebooks, edit existing ones, and run code just as you would in a local Jupyter Notebook environment.

Note that by using --ip=0.0.0.0 in step 2, you are allowing connections to your Jupyter Notebook server from any device on your network. If you only want to allow connections from specific devices, you can use a different IP address in the --ip parameter, such as --ip=192.168.1.100 to only allow connections from that specific IP address.
